# VisioFileImport

This solution will take a folder full of images (supported file types .svg, .png, .jpg, .jepg, .gif, .bmp) and will create a Visio diagram with one image per page.

The input folder should be pointed at the folder that contains the images.

The output file will be the Visio file, a default name will be provided based on the input folder name but can be changed.

This solution requires that a Visio desktop version be installed locally on the machine where this is executed.
